== Frequently Asked Questions ==


There are two possible variants of using our plugin:

= If you just want to show the booking scheme =
1. You should go to Schemes section and create a new scheme there. Scheme is just a scheme of your theatre, cinema or restaurant. There you should input name, description, width and height.

Name is just a name.
In description you should describe the event, mention the date and time and other important info.
Width – number of cells horizontally. In each cell you will be able to set a place. Each cell is like a 1 square meter.
Height – number of cells vertically.

Are you confused now? Don’t worry, we are almost there ;)

2. Now you should find your scheme in listing and click on View.
3. Here you can set places, prices etc. Use colors to group similar things. Create different places using several cells.
4. You can find a shortcode for each scheme in Schemes section. This shortcode can be embedded to any post or page.

= If you want to use the event manager =
1. You should create a scheme as we described above.
2. Then go to Events section and create an event there. There are three possible types of great calendars: month, week, day. You can choose one or several cells to create an event for. We created three color options for each event: background, border and text. Enjoy!
3. When you added, just click on event to find a shortcode.

As you understand, if you use event manager, then your booking will be closed automatically. 

That’s it! Now everybody can book a place. You will get an email about this as administrator and user will get an email too. Email templates can be edited in Settings section (‘E-mail templates’ tab). In section Orders administrator will find information about all orders.
