        <h3>How to</h3>

        <p>
            There are two possible variants of using our plugin:
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>If you just want to show the booking scheme </strong>
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                You should go to <strong>Schemes</strong> section and create a new scheme there. Scheme is just a scheme of your theatre, cinema or restaurant. There you should input name, description, width and height. <br/> <br/>
                <strong>Name</strong> is just a name. <br/>
                In <strong>description</strong> you should describe the event, mention the date and time and other important info. <br/>
                <strong>Width</strong> – number of cells horizontally. In each cell you will be able to set a place. Each cell is like a 1 square meter. <br/>
                <strong>Height</strong> – number of cells vertically. <br/> <br/>
                Are you confused a bit? Don’t worry, we are almost there :)
            </li>
            <li>
                Now you should find your scheme in listing and click on <strong>View</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Here you can set <strong>places</strong>, <strong>prices</strong> etc. Use colors to group similar things. Create different places using several cells.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can find a <strong>shortcode</strong> for each scheme in Schemes section. This shortcode can be embedded to any post or page.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            <strong>If you want to use the event manager</strong>
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                You should create a <strong>scheme</strong> as we described above.
            </li>
            <li>
                Then go to <strong>Events</strong> section and create an event there. There are three possible types of great calendars: month, week, day. You can choose one or several cells to create an event for. We created three color options for each event: background, border and text. Enjoy!
            </li>
            <li>
                When you added, just click on event to find a <strong>shortcode</strong>.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            As you understand, if you use event manager, then your booking will be closed automatically.
        </p>

        <p>
            That’s it! Now everybody can book a place. You will get an email about this as administrator and user will get an email too. Email templates can be edited in <strong>Settings</strong> section (‘<strong>E-mail templates</strong>’ tab). In section <strong>Orders</strong> administrator will find information
            about all orders.
        </p>
