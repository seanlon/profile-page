**Testimonials**

I LOVE ScheduleMAX! My clients can book online without hassle. ScheduleMAX had made being Fancy... Easy

*Tiffany C. - Skin So Fancy*

ScheduleMAX, unlike other providers, allows my clients to book multiple service appointments at the same time. The automatic confirmations and reminders my clients receive prior to their appointments are a huge timesaver for me. If that weren't enough, ScheduleMAX offers the best customer service EVER!

*Crickett The WAX Chick - Skin Care by Crickett*

Everyone (staff & patients) love that when they leave the office, by the time they get back to their email, they have confirmation of the appointment we just made...then they get a reminder the day before. Awesome! This is resolving our no shows.

*Drs. Andy & Jennifer Harmon - Peak Sports Chiropractic*
